I am new in cancer research and I need to keep up with cancer biology. When I was asked to analyse an RNA-seq data of thyroid cancer, I took it and challenged myself to perform the analysis. The RNA-seq analysis of tumor-normal is a general analysis to determine which gene is highly expressed and vice versa. Then, the gene list is subjected to an enrichment and pathway analysis to determine the pathway of affected gene in tumorigenesis.
